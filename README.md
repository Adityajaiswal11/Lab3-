# Logistic Regression Classifier
This Python script implements Logistic Regression using the scikit-learn library. Logistic Regression is a popular algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability of a class label based on input features and is often used when the target variable is categorical.

Features
Binary Classification: The code handles binary classification problems (two possible output labels).
Customizable: The script allows easy customization of hyperparameters such as the solver, regularization strength, and penalty type.
Evaluation: It provides various metrics to evaluate the performance of the model, including accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Scalable: Supports large datasets and can handle high-dimensional feature spaces efficiently.

How it Works
Loading the Data: The script loads the dataset from a CSV file, separating the input features and the target labels.
Preprocessing: This step includes handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.
Splitting the Dataset: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Training the Model: The logistic regression model is trained on the training set. The LogisticRegression class from scikit-learn is used to fit the model.
Making Predictions: Once trained, the model predicts the labels for the test set.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and a classification report to assess its performance.
Visualization: The decision boundary and model predictions can be visualized for a better understanding of the classifier's behavior.

Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted labels.
Confusion Matrix: Provides insights into true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Classification Report: Displays precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.


Visualization
For datasets with two features, a scatter plot can be used to visualize the decision boundary created by the logistic regression model. The decision boundary is where the predicted probability is 50%, and this can help to better understand the classifier's predictions.
